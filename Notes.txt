     NOTES ON SASS
------------------------



- Provides 2 file extension (.scss and .sass)

NOTE: .scss has more css like syntax as compared to .sass

- Allows Usage of Variables
- Allows Nesting of css properties
- Allows Creation of modules thus allowing us to break our files to separate sass files and 
  bring them to single file. 
  
NOTE:  with just a little setup these imports are handled during compilation
       and thus do not require multiple Http request during page load.  

- Allows us to write functions and mixins
- Allows us to inherit styles
- Allows us to use operators to do calculations
- Allows us to use conditionals
